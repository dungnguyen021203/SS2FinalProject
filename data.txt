What is HCI: HCI, or Human-Computer Interaction, is a multidisciplinary field, focusing on the design of computer technology and, more specifically, the interaction between humans (users) and computers.

What is the main goal of HCI: The main goal of HCI is to create computer products and services that are easy to use, efficient, and satisfy users.

What is User-Centered Design (UCD) in HCI: UCD is a design process focused on the user, where the user and their needs play a central role in all aspects of design and product development.

How to evaluate the performance of a user interface: Evaluating the performance of a user interface often involves considering factors such as task completion time, the number of errors users make, and user satisfaction.

How to create a user-friendly interface: To create a user-friendly interface, you need to understand the user and their needs, design with simplicity and clarity, and provide timely and useful feedback to the user.

List the principles in HCI: Here are some important principles in HCI (Human-Computer Interface): 1.Learnability: Easy for new users to engage with and achieve maximum performance. 2.Flexibility: Many ways for users and systems to exchange information. 3.Robustness: The degree of support provided to the user in determining achievement and evaluating goal-directed behavior. 4.Visibility: The state of the system must be clear. 5.Consistency and standards: The system must comply with established rules and standards. 6.Error prevention: The system must be designed to prevent user errors. 7.Recognition rather than Recall: The system must help users recognize instead of remembering. 8.Flexibility and efficiency of use: The system must be flexible and efficient in use. 9.Aesthetic and minimalist design: The system must have a minimalist and aesthetic design.


Instructions for using the prototype on figma:  Design your screens: Begin by designing the individual screens or pages of your product in Figma after that switch to Prototype model and Create connections between screens. For more detailed instructions, you may want to check out some tutorials on YouTube425 or the official Figma Help Center.

How to effectively grasp concepts in HCI: To effectively grasp the concepts in HCI, you can try applying them to real projects. Designing and testing user interfaces will help you better understand how they work and how users interact with them.

How to improve my user interface design skills: To improve your user interface design skills, you can practice design regularly, get feedback from users, and continuously update your knowledge about new trends and technologies in the HCI field.

What documents should I refer to to learn about HCI: There are many useful materials for learning about HCI, including textbooks, online lectures, and scientific research articles. Some famous textbooks on HCI include 'Designing the User Interface' by Ben Shneiderman and 'Human-Computer Interaction' by Alan Dix.

How to improve my user interface design skills: To improve your user interface design skills, you can practice designing regularly, get feedback from users, and continuously update your knowledge about new trends and technologies in the HCI field.

How to dig deeper into user interface design principles: To learn more about user interface design principles, you can refer to HCI textbooks, take online courses, or read scientific research articles in the field, for example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNzLBI0wsGU.

HCI articles help make the process of applying principles to prototyping easier: Here are some articles that can help you apply HCI principles to your prototyping process: 'Prototyping in Human Computer Interaction', 'A Comparative Study of Prototyping Methods for HCI Design Using Cognitive Load-Based Measures', 'Unveiling the Essence of HCI Design Process'.

Tips to draw better prototypes: Here are some tips for drawing beautiful prototypes: Adjust Prototype to suit the object .Prepare the subject. User Engagement (Participatory Design). Focus on User Flows and Scenarios. Make user interactions simple. Don't ignore motion effects. Sketching: Prototype for Prototype.
